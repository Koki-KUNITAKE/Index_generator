# Index_generator
Generate random DNA sequences, such that every pair of sequences has a Hamming distance larger than specified one, for use in NextSeq 1000/2000 (Two-Channel Sequencing Chemistry).

n : number of sequences. default; 20.\n
m : length of each sequence. default; 8.\n
min_haming : haming distance. default; 4.\n
gc_content : %max gc content for index seqence. default; 70.\n

other conditions:
- Each position [0 â€“ m-1] has at least one C or T across all sequences.
- Each index does not start with GG
